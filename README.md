# draw_circle_color_multi
draw_circle_color_multi is a lightweight script for Gamemaker that takes what draw_circle_color does and expands on it by giving you more control over how the circle is drawn.

What's different from draw_circle_color?

* Support for endless colors instead of just 2
* Adjust opacity for each color
* Adjust how much one fades from the previous one
* Adjust the position of the color in the radius itself

More information on how to use it can be found in the script.
